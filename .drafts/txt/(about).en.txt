
DESCRIPTION
===========
This directory ("txt") should contain text files with some basic concepts,
technologies, use cases, coding styles and other aspects of the coren
and of the process of its development as a whole (but not regarding some
individual files; in such case just write a comment in those files).

PURPOSE
=======
Files from this directory could later be used as parts of a documentation.

ENCODING
========
Natural language text files within this directory must be encoded as UTF-8.
This is a requirement for better versioning of text files (usual two-byte
Unicode breaks CR/LF-idyll because it is almost binary format). Structural
(formal) texts must be in ASCII (code 0-127 only).

FILENAMES
=========
All files must have a ".txt" as main extension. Natural language texts
must have a country/language code as a second extension. For example,
this file is named "(about).en.txt". Structural (formal) texts should not
have second extension, since they have no national characters in them.
There can be both natural language and structural texts with the same
base name of a file - this is not an error.

SPECIAL FILES
=============
File "(todo)" is a very special case: it is very dynamic and changes too
frequently. So it should not belong here, but rather it must be an external
project (probably as part of a bug/issue tracking system). But for now this
file is part of "txt" folder and will be here until that system will be
built/installed. After that all entries from "(todo)" file must be moved
to that system and the whole file must be deleted from this folder.
This paragraph too, of course.
